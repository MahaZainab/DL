# MNIST Digit Classification using Keras
This project is a simple demonstration of how to use Keras, a Python deep learning library, to build a neural network for classifying images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Project Description
The project builds a fully connected (dense) neural network with one hidden layer and an output layer. The hidden layer consists of 512 units and uses the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. The output layer uses the Softmax activation function to output a probability distribution over the 10 digit classes (0-9). The network is trained using the RMSprop optimization algorithm, and its performance is evaluated using the categorical cross-entropy loss and accuracy.
These instructions will guide you on how to run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
You need to have the following packages installed:

Python 3.x
Keras
TensorFlow

You can install these packages using pip:
pip install keras tensorflow
